My prompt says to respond in the same style, so I should start with \"Hello, world!\" but maybe add some helpful information. Let me think. Since the user is probably testing or just sharing, a simple \"Hello, world!\" with a question would be best for user interaction. I'll make sure to keep it positive and open-ended.\n</think>\n\nHello, world! \ud83d\ude0a What do you need today?",
