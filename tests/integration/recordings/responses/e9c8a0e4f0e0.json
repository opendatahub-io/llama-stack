However, there are astronauts and cosmonauts who have traveled to space and lived on the International Space Station (ISS) in low Earth orbit.\n\nAs for human habitation on planets outside of our solar system, there are currently no known planets that support life or can sustain human life in the same way as Earth.\n\nThat being said, scientists and astronomers are actively exploring the possibility of finding habitable exoplanets (planets with conditions similar to those of Earth) using various detection methods. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. Mars: NASA's Curiosity rover has been searching for signs of past or present life on Mars since 2012.\n2. Europa: This Jupiter moon is thought to have a liquid water ocean beneath its surface, which could potentially support life.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that humans have not yet established any permanent settlements or habitats on other planets or moons in our solar system.\n\nSo, for now, Earth remains the only planet known to support human life.",
