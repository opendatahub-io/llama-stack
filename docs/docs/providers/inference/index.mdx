    Llama Stack Inference API for generating completions, chat completions, and embeddings.

    This API provides the raw interface to the underlying models. Two kinds of models are supported:
    - LLM models: these models generate \"raw\" and \"chat\" (conversational) completions.
    - Embedding models: these models generate embeddings to be used for semantic search."

## Overview

Inference

    Llama Stack Inference API for generating completions, chat completions, and embeddings.

    This API provides the raw interface to the underlying models. Two kinds of models are supported:
    - LLM models: these models generate "raw" and "chat" (conversational) completions.
    - Embedding models: these models generate embeddings to be used for semantic search.

This section contains documentation for all available providers for the **inference** API.
